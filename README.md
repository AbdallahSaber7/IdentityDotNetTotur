Description:
The Identity Management System is a robust web application built on Microsoft Identity framework to manage user authentication, authorization, and user profile management. It provides a secure and centralized platform for organizations to authenticate users, manage roles and permissions, and maintain user profiles.

Key Features:

User Authentication: The system enables users to securely log in using their credentials, supporting various authentication methods such as username/password, email verification, and external authentication providers like Google, Facebook, and Microsoft accounts.

Role-based Access Control (RBAC): Administrators can define roles and permissions to control access to different parts of the system. They can assign roles to users based on their responsibilities and grant or revoke permissions as needed.

User Profile Management: Users can create and manage their profiles, update personal information, and customize account settings. They can upload profile pictures, set preferences, and manage communication preferences
